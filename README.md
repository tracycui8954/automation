In our daily work, there're cases where we need to screenshot lots of dashboards in Tableau/Looker (any visualization tool) and paste them into ppt (there are clients prefer to have ppt by hand and dont want to login to any live dashboards).It's annoying to use snippping tool for hundred times, and try to align the pictures so that they are at same location each slide. This is a simple process to screen shot, paste pictures in ppt, crop, resize and align location, and adding titles. This code will require you have a secound screen, since your first screen will be used to run these script.
